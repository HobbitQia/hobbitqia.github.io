I am Jiajun Qin (秦嘉俊 in Chinese), a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Bei YU](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/) since 2025 Fall.

Prior to that, I graduated from Zhejiang University in 2025. I had the privilege to complete a research internship at NYU SAI Lab under the supervision of [Prof.Sai Qian Zhang](https://saiqianzhang.com/). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof.Cheng Tan](https://tancheng.github.io/) from Google and [Prof.Jeff Zhang](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4346755) from ASU. Prior to this, I greatly appreciated the mentorship of [Prof.Zeke Wang](https://wangzeke.github.io/) at RC4ML at ZJU.
